The research proposal

The problem

How to improve employee satisfaction? This is a question worth answering as we would
probably expect a happy employee to be more productive, efficient and more likely
to stay with the company thus reducing the costs associated with hiring and training 
new staff.

The potential solution and the design of the study

Average employee satisfaction in HR vs. IT in each of the three countries where
IT is based. Thus 6 samples.

Average employee satisfaction between the two disciplines for all three countries combined.
2 samples.

Average IT employee satisfaction of the two countries where there is only IT, VERSUS:
Average IT employee satisfaction in the other three countries.
2 samples.

Use t-tests on these numbers. In each comparison, a p-value of less than 0.05 will be 
taken as statistically significant.

The test will be conducted in the form of a self-reported satisfaction survey, for 
employees with the company longer than 3 months:

1. How happy are you with your job on a scale of 1-10?

2. How happy are you in general on a scale of 1-10?

Based on these tests and comparisons, we should be able to determine any cross-disciplinary/
geographical variations in employee satisfaction.
