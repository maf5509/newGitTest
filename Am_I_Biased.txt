DRILL: Am I Biased?
For each of the following scenarios, call out the potential biases in the 
proposed experiment. Do your best to try to discover not only the bias, 
but the initial design. There is plenty of room for interpretation here, 
so make sure to state what assumptions you're making.


You're testing advertising emails for a bathing suit company and you test 
one version of the email in February and the other in May.

The email sent out in May likely to get a more favorable response due to 
the proximity of summer.

You open a clinic to treat anxiety and find that the people who visit show 
a higher rate of anxiety than the general population.

People who are anxious are more likely to seek psychiatric help than the 
'average' member of the population, i.e. the group of people that come
to the clinic is biased

You launch a new ad billboard based campaign and see an increase in website 
visits in the first week.

One week is not enough time to be able to gauge the success of the campaign.
This increase in site visits could be a simple spike due to random error.
The study should be designed to capture traffic over a longer period of time.

You launch a loyalty program but see no change in visits in the first week.

A better indication about the success of the program would be the increase
(or not) in business over time; the first week doesn't give much indication
 as to how well th program has done.
